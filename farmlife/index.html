                                    Write an article about my work on the farm? I didn’t want to, because I wanted my blog to be only for travel. However, I changed my mind when I realized that I was experiencing one of the most incredible adventure of my life. I realized that at the end of the day; I had just finished working. The field where we had spent the day was overlooking all the others, and the sun was slowly setting. The sun’s rays lengthened the shadows of the trees, and the wind made them dance in the fields. It was beautiful, so calm and relaxing. At that moment, I felt incredibly lucky to be a part of this landscape, to live this moment. That’s why I decided to tell you everything that happened before and after this moment, what was my life as « apprentice farmer ».

                                    Everything started at the end of January. After visiting the west coast from Perth to Esperance, it was time for us to reach the farm where we planned to work to do our 88 days of work, necessary to get our second visa. At the farm, we met Dan and his brother John, both owners of a potatoes farm. Their grandfather, of Italian origin, left his native country in 1925 for the Eldorado represented by Australia at this time. He decided to build his farm, with the intention to grow it over the years. Ninety-three years later, he would be proud to see how much his work has paid off, as his five grandchildren are now part of one of the county’s most influential families. The Omodei family is so big ! You can imagine that with five small children, who themselves have children, and even grandchildren, I can’t tell you the number of people I met during our farm months, and all those I haven’t seen. Everyone hopes that the next generation will take over the farm to develop a little more what they have worked for their entire lives. For sixteen weeks, we worked with Dan and John, Darren, with whom we became friends, and Jason, called « Brownie », a local Australian who works on different farms all the year*. From time to time, Vicky, John’s wife, joined us at the morning break.

                                    * his father was already working with the Omodei family when they didn’t have a harvester yet! Picking was done by hand, with burlap bags hanging on the body, and it was really physical and tiring.

                                Most of time, our work consisted of digging potatoes in a machine called « Harvester ». Trailed by a tractor, this machine pulls the potatoes from the ground, makes them go up on a rail which sorts once the big stones and dead grasses; then, a second rail brings us the rest and it is up to us to finish sorting, to remove bad potatoes and small stones. They end up falling in a bucket at the front of the harvester, and at the end of each line, the bucket is emptied in bins of a ton each. Every day, the orders vary, as well as the varieties: nadine, charisma, blue, red … It happened to us to have digging fifty tons in one day, but sometimes just ten tons! When we are not digging, there is always work to be done. The fields are covered with irrigation pipes, ranging from two to six inches, we must remove and put them back regularly to facilitate the advance of the tractor in the lines. When a big part of a field is finished, we have to load the pipes on a trailer and then unload them in a field that will be used next year, because they dig only half of their land a year (what isn’t used is occupied by their two hundred cows). We also had the great honor to picking stones, yes, stones ! Some fields are filled, and to facilitate the picking in the harvester next year, we went to pick up the biggest. It was a real pleasure ! As Dan and John like to diversify, they also have lobster ponds, sheep; and among their cows, they have some bulls and they sell calves. We also picked pumpkins; we learned and saw at the same time that redback loved to come and live in the pumpkins’ ass. For those who know my phobia spiders, I am now immune to any ! I would never have imagined learning as much in agriculture by spending only a few weeks on the farm. It’s a remarkable work, close to nature and where those who work there deserve the greatest respect. Since we were only two who working with them, we were much closer and could take full advantage of their knowledge and experience.

                                    Our « territory » during these almost four months stretched from Pemberton to Manjimup, the two nearest towns to the farm. Pemberton is a small town of about one thousand people, popular for the backpackers because of the surrounding farms ; you must know that where we are, it’s only fields and hills as far as the eye can see, and the main activity of the county is of course agriculture. Pemberton is surrounded by forest, and it’s beautiful; we discovered the « Cascades » of Pemberton and Big Brooke Dam, a family lake in the middle of the forest. Manjimup is bigger, and has more shops and people. I also had a crush on a restaurant, the « Tall Timbers », simply beautiful, friendly and delicious. We mainly went to Manjimup to do our shopping, and Adrien went to the skatepark regularly to do bmx. And for our greatest pleasure, we weren’t far from a motocross track. For us, french people, who live close to each other, with sometimes only a sign to separate two cities or villages, it was amazing to see that here, several tens of kilometers separate two small towns without there have any soul that lives between the two. But this life in the heart of nature is really pleasant.

                                    So obviously, I moaned a lot, some mornings I didn’t want to get up, and to others I had a mad desire to hit the road, but today, at the time I’m writing, I just finished my last day on the farm. We leave it in a few days and my heart is tight. Everything was not always very pleasant, but I met some great, genuine people; I lived several weeks in a beautiful scenery, where we live to the rhythm of nature. I had the chance to approach the wildlife closer than I would have imagined, and get up every morning, go to bed every night, with a beautiful sky, which has always a thousand colors, observe kangaroos, emus, parrots in their natural habitat, to be with all this splendid nature in everyday life, it’s more happiness than all the moments where I got tired of it. I could choose to live again and again those months, to learn and see more, and to stay with all those people we have been attached with. But the road calls us, for the continuation of a wonderful adventure, that I can’t wait to share with you.

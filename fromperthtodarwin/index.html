                                    After almost 4 months of waiting, here we are again on the road ! We were looking forward to resume our road trip after meticulously recording all the points we were interested in. After leaving the farm, we wanted to travel along the south coast again between Albany and Augusta. We were able to see Denmark and Elephant Rocks for the second time and discover West Cape Howe, including Shelley Beach, which we loved. We continued our trip to Augusta, and to Perth, rediscovering the first small coastal towns and beaches where we had gone between December and January.

                                After spending a short week in Perth, doing Rottnest Island and discovering the beautiful city of Freemantle, the big trip began. Our first stop was the Pinnacles: two hours north of Perth, the Namburg National Park offered us a sumptuous spectacle: the pinnacles, these natural sculptures, stand everywhere on the yellow sand dunes. This desert landscape is one of the most surprising, we were able to see as far as the eye can see these menhirs that can sometimes reach several meters high. The second national park of our trip was Kalbarri : we saw for the first time cliffs and gorges like the Grand Canyon in the United States. The view of the Murchinson River was awesome ! We overlooked this wilderness and could see every nook and cranny at « Nature’s Window ». Our van didn’t allow us to go to the next planned destination because some national parks are visited exclusively in 4×4, because of the roads in bad state, or sandy/rocky. We were able to sleep in a beautiful seaside location and swim a few meters from a dolphin!
                                Our favorite spot in Australia is definitely Coral Bay. Located on the seafront, this little corner of paradise has allowed us to immerse ourselves in the marine world, allowing us to get to know turtles and a multitude of colorful fishes living in the coral reef.

                                    Radical change of scenery : a few days later, after leaving the coast, we were in the heart of the Outback, in the Karijini National Park. Known for its innumerable gorges, it was a real delight to go for short hikes between these ocher and red cliffs, and the small natural pools were particularly refreshing at that time of the year. A few hundred kilometers further north, we made a small stop in the city of Broome, where the sunsets have amazed us; indeed, camels wander daily along the beach and give this place a heavenly side.
                                    After Broome, it was time for us to reach the Northern Territory and say goodbye to our beloved Western Australia who had welcomed us for more than 6 months. Full of spirit, we went to the assault of the Kimberley, in the direction of Darwin. On the road, we discovered Lake Argyle, a gigantic lake marking the boundary between the two states. Our first stop in the North was Katherine, a small town with natural hot springs. Fortunately for us, there was a lot of things to do between Katherine and Darwin so we visited several beautiful places such as Edith Falls and Litchfield National Park, where we were able to swim under incredible waterfalls. We didn’t really visit Darwin because of the warmth there, but keep a good memory: as we couldn’t swim because of crocodiles, several water parks and pools were available to us free of charge ( to our greatest delight). Our descent to Katherine, then Mataranka (still hot springs) marked the end of our visit to the Northern Territory, after a big disappointment in the Kakadu National Park (not lot of roads are ccessible by van). We were ready to embark on our long trip of three days in the Outback to join the east coast !

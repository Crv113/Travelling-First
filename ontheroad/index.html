                                <p>End 2017/early 2018 were marked by the beginning of our road trip in Western Australia. After more than a week in Perth, it was the time for us to really start what we had come for: to discover this country. The first days, we quietly descended the west coast while skirting the beaches, to reach Dunsborough and its beautiful beaches. Eagle Bay and Bunker Bay were my first favorites. Transparent water, beaches as far as the eye can see, isolated and full of charm. We stayed there for several days until we went to Wyadup Bay and the natural pools of Injidup. We were totally charmed: huge rocks overlooking the ocean where the waves come to break, creating rocks cut by the water. Below, a small natural pool has formed, and the waves come to fill it by cascading. A few kilometers further north, Canal Rocks offers us a superb show at sunset, when the waves breaks with passion right below us, perched on a small bridge.

                            <p>The following days, we went back to Perth to celebrate the New Year. It was an opportunity for us to go further north to Lancelin to see the famous white sand dunes. In the middle of nowhere, lost in a desert expanse, majestic dunes faced us, where 4WD, motorcycles and quads rushed and rolled to disappear in the distance. A little less sporty, it was the ideal place to hit the slopes on small boards, which made the happiness of families.
                                The first days of 2018 finally arrived, it was time for us to go south, to get closer to the farm where we will spend several months. A little greedy, we decided to go down to Denmark to finally see Greens Pool and Elephant Rocks, which I had been waiting for so long. Again, a turquoise water, and here, a multitude of rocks of all sizes, polished over time, out of the water and rise to become great diving and observation points. Before turning around and going to Manjimup for four months, we had the chance to stop at Lucky Bay, a beautiful beach where kangaroos come to visit you during your dinner. We turn back to the stars full of eyes, thirsty for new adventures and ready for the future, for the real tour of Australia !

                                    After years of endless waiting, London, here we are ! Lighthouse destination since my childhood, I dreamed of visiting the English capital. Thing made, thanks to my wonderful boyfriend who offered us the trip to celebrate our one year of life together. Our first day on English soil was an opportunity for us to discover the punk / rock neighborhood of Camden and his pretty little « street food stalls » in the center, then the magnificent British Museum; being passionate about history, I was in my element. For our second day we were lucky as the sun was there to cover the rays of the most beautiful monuments of the city center. We went out of the Westminster station to find themselves in front with Big Ben; each bank of the Thames offered a magnificent view either of Westminster Palace or the London Eye. Our rental is only a few steps from this beautiful place, we returned every day, completely in love. Our little walk in St James’s Park to Buckingham Palace was very relaxing, even in the middle of town, it feels like being in the campaign. After having missed the changing of the guard, we decided to continue our walk and to do shopping. Hello Soho, Trafalgar Square, and all those unmissable! The next day we met the Millennium and London Bridge, two of London’s must-see bridges. The Tower of London and the famous Gerkin were also part of the landscape. I am completely in love with St Paul’s Cathedral, a seventeenth century building with impressive architecture. To end our stay in style, we got lost in Notting Hill, going down the streets in pastel colors, then in Hyde Park, with new friends with fur very greedy. Unfortunately, London is a city full of activities, places to visit, and we will come back as soon as possible to continue to discover this wonderful city that we liked so much. Whether it’s Salisbury with his Fish and Chips, The Hummingbird Bakery with his delicious cupcakes or Regent Street and Harrods, our eyes, stomachs and hearts are always asking for more! Thank you London.

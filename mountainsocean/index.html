                                    Why choose between the sea or the mountain when you can have both during the holidays? It’s for this reason that I left with a friend in the south-west of France, in the Pyrenees and after in the Landes. I discovered for the first time these mountains and their beauty, by making me awaken by the horses in freedom around the lake of Payolle; The mist that floated above the water made this place almost mysterious. The waterfall of the Garet, halfway between Campan and La Mongie, gave us a spectacular view in the middle of the forest. I also had the chance to discover the lake of Gaube, in Cauterets, a popular destination for tourists, hikers and fishermen. After a short ascent, the lake faced us, surrounded by the mountains, as if he was asleep in the mist, and she gave way to a magnificent blue water. Our encounter of the stay was an adorable fisherman, accustomed from this place and always residing in the Pyrenees, who indicated us the most beautiful sites and the best things to do during our holidays. At the end of our mountainous journey, we took a new road, to Moliets-et-Maa, my little paradise by the sea. It was the second time I found the Courant d’Huchet with his pine forests, and his surfers. After a little misadventure that almost cost me my new camera and my phone, my stay ends around a good meal and the most sumptuous sunset. I keep wonderful memories full head and I look forward the next sea / mountain expedition !

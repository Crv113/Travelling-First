🌍 Travelling First 🌍

📅 March 2020

👋 Hey ! This project was my first one with HTML / CSS !

Travelling First was my first website. What better way to learn than by doing a personal project ?
After my 9 months of traveling in Australia I wanted to put this online to share it with my loved ones.

Today I realize that this code is not perfect, but it represents my first months in web development.

Mainly HTML/CSS, but some javascript for the photo gallery.

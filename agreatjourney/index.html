                                <p>The big departure has finally sounded. After several months of preparations, doubts, excitement, dreams and impatience, here we are, Adrien and I, about to leave everything, finally. Being able to realize this childhood dream fills me with immense joy, and at the same time fills me with fears. This trip that I imagined and so hoped for all these years will finally take shape and it is scary, in a way. Will everything be ready on time? Will « goodbye » not be too heartbreaking? Is this really the way I have to go? For the majority of the people to whom we were able to expose our project, it is a superb adventure that is preparing, but also a fashion effect because a lot of young Europeans are rushing towards this new Eldorado. But for me, this is not a sabbatical year, or a long vacation, but rather a crossroads, an important step on the path of my life that will lead me to the right road.
                                    The preparations were simpler than we expected. We want to ensure a serene departure, even if it means putting the price. Air tickets, passports, visas, insurance, luggage, the camera, the drone, and everything that includes solar batteries, universal chargers, etc., have made a hole in our budget . But the bank account has created in advance, the entire administrative done and the accommodation booked for our arrival, allows us to leave with the serene mind and to fully concentrate on the map hanging on the wall with all the points to visit. The trip from La Rochelle to Perth was long, but when our eyes were on Perth for the first time, we were not disappointed. Julia, our host for our arrival, is just lovely. She is always there to help us in our « first steps » in Australia, and she also has a little cat named Kiki who is shy but keeps being cuddly. We couldn’t dream of better home for our first days. We are in North Perth, in beautiful neighborhoods. At the end of our street is Hyde Park, a beautiful 120-year-old park filled with majestic trees.</p>

                            <p>Perth is an amazing city. With buildings as well as businessmen and businesswomen who swarm in the CBD, it is a hectic city but at the same time calm, easy to visit and in which one likes to stroll, especially along Elizabeth Quay. We quickly took our habits. A few minutes from the city center by bike, every morning we go down William Street to enjoy the sun and the good atmosphere that the bars and restaurants exude. The beaches are only a few kilometers away, so we were able to discover the Indian Ocean for the first time a few days after our arrival. Life here is really nice, especially as nature is omnipresent, even in this big city. We have already had some great encounters, including Fredericus and his wife Solange, a lovely Dutch couple settled in Perth for a few years, to whom we bought our van, which will be our companion for more than a year. Thanks to them, we go on an adventure very well equipped and serene. I can’t wait to exploring the national parks and beaches around Perth, and it promises to be even better than our expectations.</p>
